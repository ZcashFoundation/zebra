        ## Motivation
        
        `zcashd` crate dependency upgrades need to be done together, along with an upgrade to `zcash_script`.
        We don't have upgrade instructions yet, but there's a draft in #6532.
        
        The upgrade steps are:
        - [ ] upgrade and release `zcash_script`
        - [ ] upgrade Zebra's ECC and `zcash_script` dependencies in the same PR
