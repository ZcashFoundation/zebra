# This workflow manages the automatic addition of new issues to specific GitHub projects.
#
# 1. Newly opened issues are added to the "Zebra Backlog" Github project.
# 2. They are also added to the "ZF Engineering Backlog" Github project.
#
# The action makes use of the `add-to-project` action and requires a Github token
# (currently sourced from secrets) to authenticate and perform the addition.
