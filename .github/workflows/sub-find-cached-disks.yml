# Check if Cached State Disks Exist Workflow
# This workflow is designed to check the availability of cached state disks in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for different types of Zcash applications.
# - Accepts network type as input to determine which disks to search for.
# - Checks for the existence of three types of disks: lightwalletd tip, Zebra tip, and Zebra checkpoint.
# - Uses Google Cloud SDK to query and identify available disks based on network and version.
# - Outputs the availability of each disk type, which can be utilized in subsequent workflows.
# The workflow streamlines the process of verifying disk availability, crucial for optimizing and speeding up integration tests and deployments.
