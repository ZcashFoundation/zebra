# This workflow automates the building and pushing of Docker images based on user-defined inputs. It includes:
# - Accepting various inputs like image name, Dockerfile path, target, and additional Rust-related parameters.
# - Authenticates with Google Cloud and logs into Google Artifact Registry and DockerHub.
# - Uses Docker Buildx for improved build performance and caching.
# - Builds the Docker image and pushes it to both Google Artifact Registry and potentially DockerHub, depending on release type.
# - Manages caching strategies to optimize build times across different branches.
# - Uses Docker Scout to display vulnerabilities and recommendations for the latest built image.
