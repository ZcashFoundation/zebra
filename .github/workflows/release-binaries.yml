# This workflow is meant to trigger a build of Docker binaries when a release
# is published, it uses the existing `zfnd-build-docker-image.yml` workflow
#
# We use a separate action as we might want to trigger this under
# different circumstances than a Continuous Deployment, for example.
#
# This workflow is triggered if:
# - A release is published
# - A pre-release is changed to a release
