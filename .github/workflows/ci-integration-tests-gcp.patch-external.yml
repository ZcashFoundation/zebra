# Workflow patches for skipping Google Cloud unit test CI on PRs from external repositories.
name: Integration Tests on GCP

# Run on PRs from external repositories, let them pass, and then Mergify will check them.
# GitHub doesn't support filtering workflows by source branch names, so we have to do it for each
# job.
