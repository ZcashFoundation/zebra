- [ ] After creating the Design PR, take the next available RFC number (not conflicting with any lower-number RFCs) and name your RFC book/rfcs/XYZT-my-rfc.md).
- [ ] Leave the Zebra Issue number blank.  *After* the RFC is merged, create an issue to track implementation of the RFC and edit the PR description for cross-referencing.
