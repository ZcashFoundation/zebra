## Initial Testing

- [ ] After any changes, test that the `cargo install` command in `README.mdâ€™
      works (use `--path` instead of `--git` locally)

## Versioning

### Which Crates to Increment

To check if any of the top-level crates need version increments, go to the zebra GitHub code page: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra

- [ ] Increment the crates that have new commits since the last version update
- [ ] Increment any crates that depend on crates that have changed
- [ ] Use the `zebrad` crate version in the `zebrad` app code and `zebra-network` user agent
- [ ] Use the latest git tag in `README.md`

### How to Increment Versions

Zebra follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Semantic versions look like:
`MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH[`-`TAG`.`PRE-RELEASE]`

#### Pre-Release Crates

Pre-Release versions have a `TAG` like "alpha" or "beta".
For example: "1.0.0-alpha.0"

1. Increment the `PRE-RELEASE` version for the crate.

Optionally, if a `MINOR` feature pre-release breaks `MAJOR` API compatibility:
2. Increment the `MAJOR` version, and reset all the other versions to zero

#### Unstable Crates

Unstable versions have a `MAJOR` version of zero.
For example: "0.1.0"

1. Follow stable crate versioning, but increment the `MINOR` version for breaking changes

#### Stable Crates

For example: "1.0.0"

Increment the first version component in this list, and reset the other components to zero:
1. MAJOR versions for breaking public API changes and removals
  * check for types from dependencies that appear in the public API
2. MINOR versions for new features
3. PATCH versions for bug fixes
  * includes dependency updates that don't impact the public API

### Version Locations

Once you know which versions you want to increment, you can find them in the:
- [ ] zebra* `Cargo.toml`s
- [ ] tower-* `Cargo.toml`s
- [ ] `zebrad` app code: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/zebrad/src/components/tracing/component.rs
- [ ] `zebra-network` protocol user agent: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/zebra-network/src/constants.rs
- [ ] `README.md`

Merge all these version increments as one commit, by squashing and rebasing the PR onto the main branch.

## Change Log

We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

We use [the Release Drafter workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automatically create a [draft changelog](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases).

To create the final change log:
- [ ] Delete any trivial changes
- [ ] Combine duplicate changes
- [ ] Edit change descriptions so they are consistent, and make sense to non-developers
- [ ] Check the category for each change
  - prefer the "Fix" category if you're not sure
- [ ] Point the GitHub changelog to the version increment commit

#### Change Categories

From "Keep a Changelog":
* `Added` for new features.
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
* `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
* `Removed` for now removed features.
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
* `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

## Final Testing

- [ ] After tagging the release, test that the exact `cargo install` command works
      (`--git` behaves a bit differently to `--path`)

If the build fails after tagging:
1. fix the build
2. check if the fixes changed any extra crates, and do the required version increments
3. update `README.md` with a **new** git tag
4. tag **another** release
