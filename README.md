Hello! I am Zebra, an ongoing Rust implementation of a Zcash node.

Zebra is a work in progress.  It is developed as a collection of `zebra-*`
libraries implementing the different components of a Zcash node (networking,
chain structures, consensus rules, etc), and a `zebrad` binary which uses them.
