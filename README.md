[Zebra](https://zebra.zfnd.org/) is a Zcash full node written in Rust.

## Getting Started

You can run Zebra using our [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra/tags) or you can install it manually.

### Docker

This command will run our latest release, and sync it to the tip:

```sh
docker run zfnd/zebra:latest
```

For more information, read our [Docker documentation](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html).

### Manual Install

Building Zebra requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
[libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html), and a C++
compiler. Below are quick summaries for installing these dependencies.

#### General Instructions for Installing Dependencies

</summary>

1. Install [`cargo` and `rustc`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Install Zebra's build dependencies:
   - **libclang**, which is a library that comes under various names, typically
     `libclang`, `libclang-dev`, `llvm`, or `llvm-dev`;
   - **clang** or another C++ compiler (`g++,` which is for all platforms or
     `Xcode`, which is for macOS);
   - **[`protoc`](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)**.

#### Dependencies on Arch Linux

</summary>

```sh
sudo pacman -S rust clang protobuf
```

Note that the package `clang` includes `libclang` as well. The GCC version on
Arch Linux has a broken build script in a `rocksdb` dependency. A workaround is:

```sh
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -include cstdint"
```

</details>

Once you have the dependencies in place, you can install Zebra with:

```sh
cargo install --locked zebrad
```

Alternatively, you can install it from GitHub:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra --tag v2.5.0 zebrad
```

You can start Zebra by running

```sh
zebrad start
```

Refer to the [Building and Installing
Zebra](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/install.html) and [Running
Zebra](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/run.html) sections in the book for enabling
optional features, detailed configuration and further details.

## CI/CD Architecture

Zebra uses a comprehensive CI/CD system built on GitHub Actions to ensure code
quality, maintain stability, and automate routine tasks. Our CI/CD
infrastructure:

- Runs automated tests on every PR and commit.
- Manages deployments to various environments.
- Handles cross-platform compatibility checks.
- Automates release processes.

For a detailed understanding of our CI/CD system, including workflow diagrams,
infrastructure details, and best practices, see our [CI/CD Architecture
Documentation](.github/workflows/README.md).

## Documentation

The Zcash Foundation maintains the following resources documenting Zebra:

- The Zebra Book:
  - [General Introduction](https://zebra.zfnd.org/index.html),
  - [User Documentation](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user.html),
  - [Developer Documentation](https://zebra.zfnd.org/dev.html).

  - User guides of note:
    - [Zebra Health Endpoints](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/health.html) â€” liveness/readiness checks for Kubernetes and load balancers

- The [documentation of the public
  APIs](https://docs.rs/zebrad/latest/zebrad/#zebra-crates) for the latest
  releases of the individual Zebra crates.

- The [documentation of the internal APIs](https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org)
  for the `main` branch of the whole Zebra monorepo.

## User support
