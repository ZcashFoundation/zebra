# zebra ðŸ¦“

Hello! I am Zebra, an ongoing Rust implementation of a Zcash node.

Zebra is a work in progress.  It is developed as a collection of `zebra-*`
libraries implementing the different components of a Zcash node (networking,
chain structures, consensus rules, etc), and a `zebrad` binary which uses them.

Most of our work so far has gone into `zebra-network`, building a new
networking stack for Zcash, and `zebra-chain`, building foundational data
structures.
