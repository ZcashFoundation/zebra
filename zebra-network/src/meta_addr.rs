            // If two changes happen close together, the async scheduler can run their change
            // send and apply code in any order. This includes the code that records the time of
            // the change. So even if a failure happens after a response message, the failure time
            // can be recorded before the response time code is run.
            //
            // Some machines and OSes have limited time resolution, so we can't guarantee that
            // two messages on the same connection will always have different times. There are
            // also known bugs impacting monotonic times which make them go backwards or stay
            // equal. For wall clock times, clock skew is an expected event, particularly with
            // network time server updates.
            //
            // Also, the application can fail a connection independently and simultaneously
            // (or slightly before) a positive update from that peer connection. We want the
            // application change to take priority in the address book, because the connection
            // state machine also prioritises failures over any other peer messages.
            //
            // ## Resolution
            //
            // In these cases, we want to apply the failure, then ignore any nearby changes that
            // reset the address book entry to a more appealing state. This prevents peers from
            // sending updates right before failing a connection, in order to make themselves more
            // likely to get a reconnection.
            //
            // The connection state machine order is used so that state transitions which are
            // typically close together are preserved. These transitions are:
            // - NeverAttempted*->AttemptPending->(Responded|Failed)
            // - Responded->Failed
            //
            // State transitions like (Responded|Failed)->AttemptPending only happen after the
            // reconnection timeout, so they will never be considered concurrent.
