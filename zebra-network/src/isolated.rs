/// Creates a Zcash peer connection using the provided data stream.
/// This connection is completely isolated from all other node state.
///
/// The connection pool returned by [`init`](zebra_network::init)
/// should be used for all requests that
/// don't require isolated state or use of an existing TCP connection. However,
/// this low-level API is useful for custom network crawlers or Tor connections.
///
/// In addition to being completely isolated from all other node state, this
/// function also aims to be minimally distinguishable from other clients.
///
/// SECURITY TODO: check if the timestamp field can be zeroed, to remove another distinguisher (#3300)
///
/// Note that this function does not implement any timeout behavior, so callers may
/// want to layer it with a timeout as appropriate for their application.
///
/// # Inputs
///
/// - `network`: the Zcash [`Network`] used for this connection.
///
/// - `data_stream`: an existing data stream. This can be a non-anonymised TCP connection,
///                  or a Tor client [`DataStream`].
///
/// - `user_agent`: a valid BIP14 user-agent, e.g., the empty string.
