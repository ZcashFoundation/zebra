//! Abstractions that represent "the rest of the network".
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The [`PeerSet`] implementation is adapted from the one in the [Tower Balance][tower-balance] crate.
//! As described in that crate's documentation, it:
//!
//! > Distributes requests across inner services using the [Power of Two Choices][p2c].
//! >
//! > As described in the [Finagle Guide][finagle]:
//! >
//! > > The algorithm randomly picks two services from the set of ready endpoints and
//! > > selects the least loaded of the two. By repeatedly using this strategy, we can
//! > > expect a manageable upper bound on the maximum load of any server.
//! > >
//! > > The maximum load variance between any two servers is bound by `ln(ln(n))` where
//! > > `n` is the number of servers in the cluster.
//!
//! The Power of Two Choices should work well for many network requests, but not all of them.
//! Some requests should only be made to a subset of connected peers.
//! For example, a request for a particular inventory item
//! should be made to a peer that has recently advertised that inventory hash.
//! Other requests require broadcasts, such as transaction diffusion.
//!
//! Implementing this specialized routing logic inside the `PeerSet` -- so that
//! it continues to abstract away "the rest of the network" into one endpoint --
//! is not a problem, as the `PeerSet` can simply maintain more information on
//! its peers and route requests appropriately. However, there is a problem with
//! maintaining accurate backpressure information, because the `Service` trait
//! requires that service readiness is independent of the data in the request.
//!
//! For this reason, in the future, this code will probably be refactored to
//! address this backpressure mismatch. One possibility is to refactor the code
//! so that one entity holds and maintains the peer set and metadata on the
//! peers, and each "backpressure category" of request is assigned to different
//! `Service` impls with specialized `poll_ready()` implementations. Another
//! less-elegant solution (which might be useful as an intermediate step for the
//! inventory case) is to provide a way to borrow a particular backing service,
//! say by address.

//! # Behavior During Network Upgrades
//!
//! [ZIP-201] specifies peer behavior during network upgrades:
//!
//! > With scheduled network upgrades, at the activation height, nodes on each consensus branch
//! > should disconnect from nodes on other consensus branches and only accept new incoming
//! > connections from nodes on the same consensus branch.
//!
//! Zebra handles this with the help of [`MinimumPeerVersion`], which determines the minimum peer
//! protocol version to accept based on the current best chain tip height. The minimum version is
//! therefore automatically increased when the block height reaches a network upgrade's activation
//! height. The helper type is then used to:
//!
//! - cancel handshakes to outdated peers, in
//!   [`handshake::negotiate_version`][crate::peer::handshake::negotiate_version]
//! - cancel requests to and disconnect from peers that have become outdated, in
//!   [`PeerSet::push_unready`]
//! - disconnect from peers that have just responded and became outdated, in
//!   [`PeerSet::poll_unready`]
//! - disconnect from idle peers that have become outdated, in
//!   [`PeerSet::disconnect_from_outdated_peers`]
//!
//! ## Network Coalescence
//!
//! [ZIP-201] also specifies how Zcashd behaves [leading up to a activation
//! height][network-coalescence]. Since Zcashd limits the number of connections to at most eight
//! peers, it will gradually migrate its connections to up-to-date peers as it approaches the
//! activation height.
//!
//! The motivation for this behavior is to avoid an abrupt partitioning the network, which can lead
//! to isolated peers and increases the chance of an eclipse attack on some peers of the network.
//!
//! Zebra does not gradually migrate its peers as it approaches an activation height. This is
//! because Zebra by default can connect to up to 75 peers, as can be seen in [`Config::default`].
//! Since this is a lot larger than the 8 peers Zcashd connects to, an eclipse attack becomes a lot
//! more costly to execute, and the probability of an abrupt network partition that isolates peers
//! is lower.
//!
//! Even if a Zebra node is manually configured to connect to a smaller number of peers, the
//! [`AddressBook`] is configured to hold a large number of peer addresses
//! ([`MAX_ADDRS_IN_ADDRESS_BOOK`]). Since the address book prioritizes addresses it trusts (like
//! those that it has successfully connected to before), the node should be able to recover and
//! rejoin the network by itself, as long as the address book is populated with enough entries.
//!
