# Tachyon

The Tachyon shielded transaction protocol for Zcash.

Tachyon is a scaling solution that enables:

- **Proof Aggregation**: Aggregates multiple Halo proofs into a single Ragu proof per block
- **Oblivious Synchronization**: Wallets can outsource sync to untrusted services
- **Polynomial Accumulators**: Unified tracking of note commitments and nullifiers via tachygrams

## Status

This crate is currently a stub/placeholder for progressive development.
