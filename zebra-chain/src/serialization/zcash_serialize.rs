///
/// Use `zcash_serialize_external_count` when the array count is determined by
/// other data, or a consensus rule.
///
/// Use `Vec::zcash_serialize` for data that contains compactsize count,
/// followed by the data array.
///
/// For example, when a single count applies to multiple arrays:
/// 1. Use `Vec::zcash_serialize` for the array that has a data count.
/// 2. Use `zcash_serialize_external_count` for the arrays with no count in the
///    data, passing the length of the first array.
///
/// This function has a `zcash_` prefix to alert the reader that the
/// serialization in use is consensus-critical serialization, rather than
/// some other kind of serialization.
