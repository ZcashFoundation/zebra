//! Unmined Zcash transaction identifiers and transactions.
//!
//! Transaction version 5 is uniquely identified by [`WtxId`] when unmined, and
//! [`struct@Hash`] in the blockchain. The effects of a v5 transaction
//! (spends and outputs) are uniquely identified by the same
//! [`struct@Hash`] in both cases.
//!
//! Transaction versions 1-4 are uniquely identified by legacy
//! [`struct@Hash`] transaction IDs, whether they have been mined or not.
//! So Zebra, and the Zcash network protocol, don't use witnessed transaction
//! IDs for them.
//!
//! Zebra's [`UnminedTxId`] and [`UnminedTx`] enums provide the correct unique
//! ID for unmined transactions. They can be used to handle transactions
//! regardless of version, and get the [`WtxId`] or [`struct@Hash`] when
//! required.
