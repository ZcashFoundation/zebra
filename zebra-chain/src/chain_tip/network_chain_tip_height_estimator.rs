//! A module with helper code to estimate the network chain tip's height.

/// A type used to estimate the chain tip height at a given time.
///
/// The estimation is based on a known block time and height for a block. The estimator will then
/// handle any target spacing changes to extrapolate the provided information into a target time
/// and obtain an estimation for the height at that time.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// 1. Use [`NetworkChainTipHeightEstimator::new`] to create and initialize a new instance with the
///    information about a known block.
/// 2. Use [`NetworkChainTipHeightEstimator::estimate_height_at`] to obtain a height estimation for
///    a given instant.
