See the [user documentation](https://zebra.zfnd.org/user.html) for details on
how to build, run, and instrument Zebra.

## Bug Reports
[bug-reports]: #bug-reports

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&labels=C-bug%2C+S-needs-triage&projects=&template=bug_report.yml&title=) on the Zebra issue tracker.

## Pull Requests
[pull-requests]: #pull-requests

PRs are welcome for small and large changes, but please don't make large PRs
without coordinating with us via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/yVNhQwQE68). This helps
increase development coordination and makes PRs easier to merge. Low-effort PRs, including but not limited to fixing typos and grammatical corrections, will generally be redone by us to dissuade metric farming.

Check out the [help wanted][hw] or [good first issue][gfi] labels if you're

Zebra follows the [conventional commits][conventional] standard for the commits

should follow the conventional commits standard so that the merged commits
are conformant.
