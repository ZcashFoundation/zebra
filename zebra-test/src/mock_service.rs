//! Some helpers to make it simpler to mock Tower services.
//!
//! A [`MockService`] is a generic [`tower::Service`] implementation that allows intercepting
//! requests, responding to them individually, and checking that there are no requests to be
//! received (at least during a period of time). The [`MockService`] can be built for proptests or
//! for normal Rust unit tests.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use zebra_test::mock_service::MockService;
//! # use tower::ServiceExt;
//!
//! # let reactor = tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread()
//! #     .enable_all()
//! #     .build()
//! #     .expect("Failed to build Tokio runtime");
//! #
//! # reactor.block_on(async {
//! let mut mock_service = MockService::build().for_unit_tests();
//! let mut service = mock_service.clone();
//! #
//! # // Add types to satisfy the compiler's type inference for the `Error` type.
//! # let _typed_mock_service: MockService<_, _, _> = mock_service.clone();
//!
//! let call = tokio::spawn(mock_service.clone().oneshot("hello"));
//!
//! mock_service
//!     .expect_request("hello").await
//!     .respond("hi!");
//!
//! mock_service.expect_no_requests().await;
//!
//! let response = call
//!     .await
//!     .expect("Failed to run call on the background")
//!     .expect("Failed to receive response from service");
//!
//! assert_eq!(response, "hi!");
//! # });
//! ```
