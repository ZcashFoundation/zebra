## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6) - 2023-03-23

In this release, we fixed several minor security issues, most notably [hardening Zebra in response to the vulnerabilities recently disclosed by Halborn](https://zfnd.org/statement-on-recent-security-disclosures-by-halborn/).

### Known Issues

- `orchard` 0.3.0 can't verify `halo2` proofs when compiled with Rust 1.69 or later (currently beta and nightly Rust). Compile Zebra with stable Rust to avoid this bug. ([halo2/#737](https://github.com/zcash/halo2/issues/737)).
Zebra tracking issue for this problem is [#6232](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/6232).

### Security

- Harden Zebra's network protocol implementation in response to the Halborn disclosures ([#6297](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6297))
- Bump incrementalmerkletree from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1, resolving a consensus bug on 32-bit platforms ([#6258](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6258))
- Remove unused dependencies, and check for them in CI ([#6216](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6216))
- Validate address length before reading ([#6320](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6320), [#6368](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6368))

### Added

- Add instructions for mining with s-nomp to Zebra book ([#6220](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6220))
- Export block data to elasticsearch database ([#6274](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6274))
- Add elasticsearch section to Zebra book ([#6295](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6295))

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.5) - 2023-02-23

This release:

- finishes the implementation of mining-related RPCs;
- makes Zebra ready for testing and initial adoption by mining pools;
- adds support for the latest version of `lightwalletd`;
- makes non-finalized chain forks instant;
- contains other improvements such as deduplication of RedPallas code.

Zebra now also checks that it is following the consensus chain each time it
starts up.

### Security

- Check that Zebra's state contains the consensus chain each time it starts up.
  This implements the "settled network upgrade" consensus rule using all of
  Zebra's checkpoints
  ([#6163](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6163)).

  _User action required:_

  - If your config is based on an old version of Zebra, or you have manually
    edited it, make sure `consensus.checkpoint_sync = true`. This option has
    been true by default since March 2022.

- Bump hyper from 0.14.23 to 0.14.24, fixing a denial of service risk ([#6094](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6094))
- Re-verify transactions that were verified at a different tip height ([#6154](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6154))
- Fix minute-long delays in block verification after a chain fork ([#6122](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6122))

### Deprecated

- The `consensus.checkpoint_sync` config in `zebrad.toml` is deprecated. It might be ignored or
  removed in a future release. ([#6163](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6163))

### Added

- Log a cute message for blocks that were mined by Zebra (off by default) ([#6098](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6098))
- Add extra `getblock` RPC fields used by some mining pools ([#6097](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6097))
- Get details from transaction differences in `getrawmempool` RPC ([#6035](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6035))

#### New RPCs

- Implement the `z_listunifiedreceivers` RPC ([#6171](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6171))
- Implement the `getblocksubsidy` RPC ([#6032](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6032))
- Implement the `validateaddress` RPC ([#6086](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6086))
- Implement the `z_validateaddress` RPC ([#6185](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6185))
- Implement the `getdifficulty` RPC ([#6099](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6099))

#### Documentation

- Add detailed testnet mining docs to the Zebra repository ([#6201](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6201))
- Add mining instructions to the zebra book ([#6199](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6199))

### Changed

- Use `reddsa` crate and remove duplicated RedPallas code ([#6013](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6013))
- Upgrade to the zcash_primitives 0.10 API ([#6087](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6087))
- Simplify `getdifficulty` RPC implementation ([#6105](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6105))

### Fixed

- Change error format in proposals ([#6044](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6044))
- Fix `lightwalletd` instructions to be compatible with Zebra ([#6088](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6088))
- Downgrade `owo-colors` from 3.6.0 to 3.5.0 ([#6203](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6203))
- Make RPC "incorrect parameters" error code match `zcashd` ([#6066](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6066))
- Make the verbosity argument optional in the getblock RPC ([#6092](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6092))
- Increase legacy chain limit to 100,000 ([#6053](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6053))

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.4](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.4) - 2023-01-30

In this release we fixed bugs and inconsistencies between zcashd and zebrad in the output of the `getblocktemplate` RPC method. In addition, we added block proposal mode to the `getblocktemplate` RPC, while we continue the effort of adding and testing mining pool RPC methods.

### Security

- Verify the lock times of mempool transactions. Previously, Zebra was ignoring mempool transaction lock times, but checking them in mined blocks. Credit to DeckerSU for reporting this issue. ([#6027](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6027))
- Bump bumpalo from 3.8.0 to 3.12.0, removing undefined behaviour on `wasm` targets. These targets are not supported Zebra platforms. ([#6015](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6015))
- Bump libgit2-sys from 0.14.0+1.5.0 to 0.14.2+1.5.1, to ensure that SSH server keys are checked. Zebra only uses `libgit2` during builds, and we don't make SSH connections. ([#6014](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6014))
- Bump tokio from 1.24.1 to 1.24.2, to fix unsoundness. The unsound methods are not directly used by Zebra. ([#5995](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5995))

### Added

- Add getpeerinfo RPC method ([#5951](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5951))
- Add proposal capability to getblocktemplate ([#5870](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5870))
- Add a test to check that the Docker image config works ([#5968](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5968))
- Make `zebra-checkpoints` work for zebrad backend ([#5894](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5894), [#5961](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5961))
- Add test dependency from zebra-rpc to zebra-network with correct features ([#5992](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5992))
- Document zebra download command ([#5901](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5901))

### Fixed

- Return detailed errors to the RPC client when a block proposal fails ([#5993](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5993))
- Avoid selecting duplicate transactions in block templates ([#6006](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6006))
- Calculate getblocktemplate RPC testnet min and max times correctly ([#5925](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5925))
- Fix Merkle root transaction order in getblocktemplate RPC method ([#5953](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5953))

### Changed

- Strings in zebra configuration file now use double quotes, caused by upgrading the `toml` crate. Old configs will still work [#6029](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6029)

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3) - 2023-01-10

This release continues our work on mining pool RPCs, and brings Zebra up to date with the latest [ZIP-317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317) changes. It also fixes a minor network protocol compatibility bug.

As part of this release, we upgraded `tokio` to fix potential hangs and performance issues. We encourage all users to upgrade to the latest Zebra version to benefit from these fixes.

### Breaking Changes

- Zebra now requires at least Rust 1.65, because we have started using new language features.
  Any Zebra release can increase the required Rust version: only the latest stable Rust version is supported.

### Security

- Upgrade tokio from 1.22.0 to 1.23.0 to fix potential hangs and performance issues ([#5802](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5802))
- Refactor block subsidy to handle Height::MAX without panicking ([#5787](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5787))
- Update ZIP-317 transaction selection algorithm in the `getblocktemplate` RPC ([#5776](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5776))

### Added

- Add the `getmininginfo`, `getnetworksolps` and `getnetworkhashps` RPC methods ([#5808](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5808))
- Add long polling support to the `getblocktemplate` RPC ([#5772](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5772), [#5796](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5796), [#5837](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5837), [#5843](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5843), [#5862](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5862))
- Populate `blockcommitmenthash` and `defaultroot` fields in the getblocktemplate RPC ([#5751](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5751))
- Support transparent p2pkh miner addresses in the `getblocktemplate` RPC ([#5827](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5827))

### Changed

- Automatically re-verify mempool transactions after a chain fork, rather than re-downloading them all ([#5841](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5841))
- Try to match `zcashd`'s `getblocktemplate` exactly ([#5867](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5867))
- Accept a hash or a height as the first parameter of the `getblock` RPC ([#5861](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5861))
- Wait for 3 minutes to check Zebra is synced to the tip, rather than 2 ([#5840](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5840))
- Update mainnet and testnet checkpoints ([#5928](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5928))

### Fixed

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2) - 2022-12-06

Zebra's latest release continues work on mining pool RPCs, fixes a rare RPC crash that could lead to memory corruption, and uses the ZIP-317 conventional fee for mempool size limits.

Zebra's consensus rules, node sync, and `lightwalletd` RPCs are ready for user testing and experimental use. Zebra has not been audited yet.

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:
- Evict transactions from the mempool using the ZIP-317 conventional fee ([#5703](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5703))
  - If there are a lot of unmined transactions on the Zcash network, and Zebra's mempool
    becomes full, Zebra will penalise transactions that don't pay at least the ZIP-317
    conventional fee. These transactions will be more likely to get evicted.
  - The ZIP-317 convention fee increases based on the number of logical transparent or
    shielded actions in a transaction.
  - This change has no impact under normal network conditions.

### Security

- Fix a rare crash and memory errors when Zebra's RPC server shuts down ([#5591](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5591))
- Evict transactions from the mempool using the ZIP-317 conventional fee ([#5703](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5703))

### Added

- Add submitblock RPC method ([#5526](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5526))
- Add a `mining` section with miner address to config ([#5491](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5508))

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1) - 2022-11-02

This is the second Zebra release candidate. Zebra's consensus rules, node sync, and `lightwalletd` RPCs are ready for user testing and experimental use. Zebra has not been audited yet.

This release starts work on mining pool RPCs, including some mempool fixes. It also restores support for Rust 1.64.

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:
- Remove unused buggy cryptographic code from zebra-chain ([#5464](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5464), [#5476](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5476)). This code was never used in production, and it had known bugs. Anyone using it should migrate to `librustzcash` instead.

### Added

- Introduce `getblocktemplate-rpcs` feature ([#5357](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5357))
  - Add getblockcount rpc method ([#5357](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5357))
  - Add getblockhash rpc method ([#4967](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/4967))
  - Add getblocktemplate rpc call with stub fields ([#5462](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5462))
- Add block commit task metrics ([#5327](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5327))
- Document how we tag and release Zebra ([#5392](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5392))
- Document how to use Zebra with Docker ([#5504](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5504))

### Changed

- Update mainnet and testnet checkpoints ([#5512](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5512))

### Fixed

- Reject mempool transactions with spent outpoints or nullifiers ([#5434](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5434))
- Allow extra lookahead blocks in the verifier, state, and block commit task queues. This reduces the number of downloaded blocks that are dropped due to the lookahead limit. ([#5465](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5465))

## [Zebra 1.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0) - 2022-10-12

This is the first Zebra release candidate. Zebra's consensus rules, node sync, and `lightwalletd` RPCs are ready for user testing and experimental use. Zebra has not been audited yet.

This release also makes significant performance improvements to RPCs, and temporarily removes support for Rust 1.64.

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:
- Rust 1.64 is unsupported due to a performance regression when downloading the Zcash parameters.
  Zebra currently builds with Rust 1.63 ([#5251](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5251)).
- Use correct TOML syntax in Docker zebrad.toml ([#5320](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5320))

### Major RPC Performance Improvements

This release improves RPC performance:
- Initial `lightwalletd` sync is about twice as fast ([#5307](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5307))
- RPCs can run while a block is being committed to the state, previously they could be delayed by 5-15 seconds ([#5134](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5134), [#5257](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5257))

### Security

- Make default command work in docker images, disable optional listener ports ([#5313](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5313))
- Update yanked versions of cpufeatures (orchard/aes), ed25519 (tor), and quick-xml (flamegraph) ([#5308](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5308))
- Bump rand\_core from 0.6.3 to 0.6.4, fixes unsoundness bug ([#5175](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5175))

### Changed

- Log git metadata and platform info when zebrad starts up ([#5200](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5200))
- Update mainnet and testnet checkpoints ([#5360](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5360))
- Update README for the release candidate ([#5314](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5314))
- change(docs): Add links to CI/CD docs in the zebra book's sidebar ([#5355](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5355))

### Fixed

- Use correct TOML syntax in Docker zebrad.toml ([#5320](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5320))
- Look back up to 10,000 blocks on testnet for a legacy chain ([#5133](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5133))

#### Performance

- Build zebrad with Rust 1.63 to avoid Zcash parameter download hangs ([#5251](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5251))
- Write blocks to the state in a separate thread, to avoid network and RPC hangs ([#5134](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5134), [#5257](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5257))
- Fix slow getblock RPC (verbose=1) using transaction ID index ([#5307](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5307))
- Open the database in a blocking tokio thread, which allows tokio to run other tasks  ([#5228](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/5228))

## [Zebra 1.0.0-beta.15](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.15) - 2022-09-20

This release improves Zebra's sync and RPC performance, improves test coverage and reliability, and starts creating Docker Hub binaries for releases.

It also changes some of `zebra-network`'s unstable Rust APIs to provide more peer metadata.

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:
- Zebra's JSON-RPC server has an isolated thread pool, which is single threaded by default (#4806).
  Multi-threaded RPCs disable port conflict detection, allowing multiple Zebra instances to share
  the same RPC port (#5013).
  To activate multi-threaded RPC server requests, add this config to your `zebrad.toml`:

```toml
[rpc]
parallel_cpu_threads = 0
```

- Docker users can now specify a custom `zebrad` config file path (#5163, #5177).
  As part of this feature, the default config path in the Docker image was changed.

- `zebrad` now uses a non-blocking tracing logger (#5032).
  If the log buffer fills up, Zebra will discard any additional logs.
  Moving logging to a separate thread also changes the timing of some logs,
  this is unlikely to affect most users.

- Zebra's gRPC tests need `protoc` installed (#5009).
  If you are running Zebra's `lightwalletd` gRPC test suite, [see the `tonic` README for details.](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic#dependencies)

## [Zebra 1.0.0-beta.13](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.13) - 2022-07-29

This release fixes multiple bugs in proof and signature verification, which were causing big performance issues near the blockchain tip.
It also improves Zebra's sync performance and reliability under heavy load.

### Disk and Network Usage Changes

Zebra now uses around 50 - 100 GB of disk space, because many large transactions were recently added to the block chain. (In the longer term, several hundred GB are likely to be needed.)

When there are a lot of large user-generated transactions on the network, Zebra can upload or download 1 GB or more per day.

### Configuration Changes

- Split the checkpoint and full verification [`sync` concurrency options](https://doc.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/config/struct.SyncSection.html) (#4726, #4758):
  - Add a new `full_verify_concurrency_limit`
  - Rename `max_concurrent_block_requests` to `download_concurrency_limit`
  - Rename `lookahead_limit` to `checkpoint_verify_concurrency_limit`
  For backwards compatibility, the old names are still accepted as aliases.
- Add a new `parallel_cpu_threads` [`sync` concurrency option](https://doc.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/config/struct.SyncSection.html) (#4776).
  This option sets the number of threads to use for CPU-bound tasks, such as proof and signature verification.
  By default, Zebra uses all available CPU cores.

### Rust Compiler Bug Fixes

- The Rust team has recently [fixed compilation bugs](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/07/19/Rust-1.62.1.html) in function coercions of `impl Trait` return types, and `async fn` lifetimes.
  We recommend that you update your Rust compiler to release 1.62.1, and re-compile Zebra.

### Added

- Add a `rayon` thread pool for CPU-bound tasks (#4776)
- Run multiple cryptographic batches concurrently within each verifier (#4776)
- Run deserialization of transaction in a rayon thread (#4801)
- Run CPU-intensive state updates in parallel rayon threads (#4802)
- Run CPU-intensive state reads in parallel rayon threads (#4805)
- Support Tiers and supported platforms per Tier doc (#4773)

### Changed

- Update column family names to match Zebra's database design (#4639)
- Update Zebra's mainnet and testnet checkpoints (#4777, #4833)
- Process more blocks and batch items concurrently, so there's a batch ready for each available CPU (#4776)
- Wrap note commitment trees in an `Arc`, to reduce CPU and memory usage (#4757)
- Increment `tokio` dependency from 1.19.2 to 1.20.0, to improve diagnostics (#4780)

### Fixed

- Only verify halo2 proofs once per transaction (#4752)
- Use a separate channel for each cryptographic batch, to avoid dropped batch results (#4750)
- Improve batch fairness and latency under heavy load (#4750, #4776)
- Run all verifier cryptography on blocking CPU-bound threads, using `tokio` and `rayon`  (#4750, #4776)
- Use `tokio`'s `PollSemaphore`, instead of an outdated `Semaphore` impl (#4750)
- Check batch worker tasks for panics and task termination (#4750, #4777)

- Stop panicking when the connection error slot is not set (#4770)
- When writing blocks to disk, don't block other async tasks (#4199)
- When sending headers to peers, only deserialize the header data from disk (#4792)
- Return errors from `send_periodic_heartbeats_with_shutdown_handle` (#4756)
- Make FindHeaders and FindHashes run concurrently with state updates (#4826)
- Stop reading redundant blocks for every FindHashes and FindHeaders request (#4825)
- Generate sapling point outside the method (#4799)

#### CI

- Workaround lightwalletd hangs by waiting until we're near the tip (#4763)
- Split out Canopy logs into a separate job (#4730)
- Make full sync go all the way to the tip (#4709)
- Split Docker logs into sprout, other checkpoints, and full validation (#4704)
- Add a Zebra cached state update test, fix lightwalletd tests (#4813)


## [Zebra 1.0.0-beta.12](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.12) - 2022-06-29

This release improves Zebra's Orchard proof verification performance and sync performance.
Zebra prefers to connect to peers on the canonical Zcash ports.

This release also contains some breaking changes which:
- improve usability, and
- make Zebra compile faster.

### Breaking Changes

#### Cache Deletion

- Zebra deletes unused cached state directories in `<OS-specific cache dir>/zebra` (#4586)
  These caches only contain public chain data, so it is safe to delete them.

#### Compile-Time Features

- Most of Zebra's [tracing](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/book/src/user/tracing.md)
  and [metrics](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/book/src/user/metrics.md) features
  are off by default at compile time (#4539, #4680)
- The `enable-sentry` feature has been renamed to `sentry` (#4623)

#### Config

- Times in `zebrad.config` change from seconds/nanoseconds to a
  [human-readable format](https://docs.rs/humantime/latest/humantime/).
  Remove times in the old format, or use `zebrad generate` to create a new config. (#4587)

## [Zebra 1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2) - 2021-12-03

Zebra's latest beta continues implementing zero-knowledge proof and note commitment tree validation. In this release, we have finished implementing transaction header, transaction amount, and Zebra-specific NU5 validation. (NU5 mainnet validation is waiting on an `orchard` crate update, and some consensus parameter updates.)

We also fix a number of security issues that could pose a local denial of service risk, or make it easier for an attacker to make a node follow a false chain.

As of this release, Zebra will automatically download and cache the Sprout and Sapling Groth16 circuit parameters. The cache uses around 1 GB of disk space. These cached parameters are shared across all Zebra and `zcashd` instances run by the same user.

## [Zebra v1.0.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.0) - 2021-01-30

Zebra first alpha release 🎉

The goals of this release are to:
- participate in the Zcash network,
- replicate the Zcash chain state,
- implement the Zcash proof of work consensus rules, and
- sync on Mainnet under excellent network conditions.

Currently, Zebra does not validate all the Zcash consensus rules.
It may be unreliable on Testnet, and under less-than-perfect
network conditions.
