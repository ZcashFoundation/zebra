## [Zebra v1.0.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.0) - 2021-01-30

Zebra first alpha release 🎉

The goals of this release are to:
- participate in the Zcash network,
- replicate the Zcash chain state,
- implement the Zcash proof of work consensus rules, and
- sync on Mainnet under excellent network conditions.

Currently, Zebra does not validate all the Zcash consensus rules.
It may be unreliable on Testnet, and under less-than-perfect
network conditions.
