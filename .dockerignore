# Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, it looks for a file
# named .dockerignore in the root directory of the context. If this file exists, the
# CLI modifies the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it.
#
# You may want to specify which files to include in the context, rather than which
# to exclude. To achieve this, specify * as the first pattern, followed by one or
# more ! exception patterns.

# Exclude everything:

# Now un-exclude required files and folders:

!.cargo
!.config
!*.toml
!*.lock
!tower-*
!zebra-*
!zebrad
!docker/entrypoint.sh
!docker/default-zebra-config.toml
