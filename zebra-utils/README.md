# Zebra Utilities

Tools for maintaining and testing Zebra:

- [zebra-checkpoints](#zebra-checkpoints)
- [zebrad-hash-lookup](#zebrad-hash-lookup)
- [zebrad-log-filter](#zebrad-log-filter)
- [zcash-rpc-diff](#zcash-rpc-diff)
- [scanning-results-reader](#scanning-results-reader)

Binaries are easier to use if they are located in your system execution path.

## zebra-checkpoints

This command generates a list of zebra checkpoints, and writes them to standard output. Each checkpoint consists of a block height and hash.

#### Automatic Checkpoint Generation in CI

Zebra's GitHub workflows automatically generate checkpoints after every `main` branch update.
These checkpoints can be copied into the `main-checkpoints.txt` and `test-checkpoints.txt` files.

To find the latest checkpoints on the `main` branch:
1. Find the [latest completed `CI Docker` workflow run on `main`](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/actions/workflows/continous-integration-docker.yml?query=branch%3Amain).
   Due to GitHub UI issues, some runs will show as waiting, cancelled, or failed,
   but the checkpoints have still been generated.
2. Go to the `Result of checkpoints-mainnet` step in the
   `Run checkpoints-mainnet` job, in the `Generate checkpoints mainnet` job
3. Scroll down until you see the list of checkpoints, it should start around line 200
4. Add those checkpoints to the end of `zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/main-checkpoints.txt`
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for `Generate checkpoints testnet`
6. Open a pull request at https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pulls

#### Manual Checkpoint Generation

To create checkpoints, you need a synchronized instance of `zebrad` or `zcashd`.
`zebrad` can be queried directly or via an installed `zcash-cli` RPC client.
`zcashd` must be queried via `zcash-cli`, which performs the correct RPC authentication.

#### Checkpoint Generation Setup

Make sure your `zebrad` or `zcashd` is [listening for RPC requests](https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebra_rpc/config/struct.Config.html#structfield.listen_addr),
and synced to the network tip.

If you are on a Debian system, `zcash-cli` [can be installed as a package](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/master/rtd_pages/install_debian_bin_packages.html).

`zebra-checkpoints` is a standalone rust binary, you can compile it using:

```sh
cargo install --locked --features zebra-checkpoints --git https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra zebra-utils
```

#### Checkpoint Generation Commands

You can update the checkpoints using these commands:
```sh
zebra-checkpoints --last-checkpoint $(tail -1 zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/main-checkpoints.txt | cut -d" " -f1) | tee --append zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/main-checkpoints.txt &
zebra-checkpoints --last-checkpoint $(tail -1 zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/test-checkpoints.txt | cut -d" " -f1) -- -testnet | tee --append zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/test-checkpoints.txt &
wait
```

When updating the lists there is no need to start from the genesis block. The program option
`--last-checkpoint` will let you specify at what block height you want to start. Usually, the
maintainers will copy the last height from each list, and start from there.

Other useful options are:
- `--transport direct`: connect directly to a `zebrad` instance
- `--addr`: supply a custom RPC address and port for the node
- `-- -testnet`: connect the `zcash-cli` binary to a testnet node instance

You can see all the `zebra-checkpoints` options using:

```sh
target/release/zebra-checkpoints --help
```

For more details about checkpoint lists, see the [`zebra-checkpoints` README.](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-consensus/src/checkpoint/README.md)

#### Checkpoint Generation for Testnet

To update the testnet checkpoints, `zebra-checkpoints` needs to connect to a testnet node.

To launch a testnet node, you can either:
- start `zebrad` [with a `zebrad.toml` with `network.network` set to `Testnet`](https://docs.rs/zebra-network/latest/zebra_network/struct.Config.html#structfield.network), or
- run `zcashd -testnet`.

Then use the commands above to regenerate the checkpoints.

#### Submit new checkpoints as pull request

- If you started from the last checkpoint in the current list, add the checkpoint list to the end
  of the existing checkpoint file. If you started from genesis, replace the entire file.
- Open a pull request with the updated Mainnet and Testnet lists at:
  https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pulls

## zebrad-hash-lookup

Given a block hash the script will get additional information using `zcash-cli`.

```sh
$ echo "00000001f53a5e284393dfecf2a2405f62c07e2503047a28e2d1b6e76b25f863" | zebrad-hash-lookup

$
```
This program is commonly used as part of `zebrad-log-filter` where hashes will be captured from `zebrad` output.

## zebrad-log-filter

The program is designed to filter the output from the zebra terminal or log file. Each time a hash is seen the script will capture it and get the additional information using `zebrad-hash-lookup`.

Assuming `zebrad`, `zclash-cli`, `zebrad-hash-lookup` and `zebrad-log-filter` are in your path the program can used as:

```sh
$ zebrad -v start | zebrad-log-filter
...
block::Hash("

"))) max_checkpoint_height=Height(419581)
...
```

## zcash-rpc-diff

This program compares `zebrad` and `zcashd` RPC responses.

Make sure you have zcashd and zebrad installed and synced.

The script:
1. gets the `zebrad` and `zcashd` tip height and network
2. sends the RPC request to both of them using `zcash-cli`
3. compares the responses using `diff`
4. leaves the full responses in files in a temporary directory, so you can check them in detail
5. if possible, compares different RPC methods for consistency

Assuming `zebrad`'s RPC port is 28232, you should be able to run:
```sh
$ zebra-utils/zcash-rpc-diff 28232 getinfo
Checking zebrad network and tip height...
Checking zcashd network and tip height...

Request:
getinfo

Querying zebrad main chain at height 1649797...
Querying zcashd main chain at height 1649797...

Response diff (between zcashd port and port 28232):

```

Sometimes zcashd will have extra fields (`+`) or different data (`-` and `+`).
And sometimes it will have the same data, but in a different order.

The script will warn you if the heights or networks are different,
then display the results of querying the mismatched node states.

The script accepts any RPC, with any number of arguments.
If a node doesn't implement an RPC, the script will exit with an error.

#### Configuration

The script uses the configured `zcash-cli` RPC port,
and the `zebrad` port supplied on the command-line.

It doesn't actually check what kind of node it is talking to,
so you can compare two `zcashd` or `zebrad` nodes if you want.
(Just edit the `zcash.conf` file used by `zcash-cli`, or edit the script.)

You can override the binaries the script calls using these environmental variables:
- `$ZCASH_CLI`
- `$DIFF`
- `$JQ`

## Scanning Results Reader

A utility for displaying Zebra's scanning results.

### How It Works

1. Opens Zebra's scanning storage and reads the results containing scanning keys
   and TXIDs.
2. Fetches the transactions by their TXIDs from Zebra using the
   `getrawtransaction` RPC.
3. Decrypts the tx outputs using the corresponding scanning key.
4. Prints the memos in the outputs.

### How to Try It

#### Scan the Block Chain with Zebra

1. Add a viewing key to your Zebra config file. For example:

   ``` toml
   [shielded_scan.sapling_keys_to_scan]
   "zxviews1q0duytgcqqqqpqre26wkl45gvwwwd706xw608hucmvfalr759ejwf7qshjf5r9aa7323zulvz6plhttp5mltqcgs9t039cx2d09mgq05ts63n8u35hyv6h9nc9ctqqtue2u7cer2mqegunuulq2luhq3ywjcz35yyljewa4mgkgjzyfwh6fr6jd0dzd44ghk0nxdv2hnv4j5nxfwv24rwdmgllhe0p8568sgqt9ckt02v2kxf5ahtql6s0ltjpkckw8gtymxtxuu9gcr0swvz" = 1
   ```
   This key is from [ZECpages](https://zecpages.com/boardinfo).

2. Make sure Zebra runs on Mainnet and listens on the default RPC port by having
   the following in the same config file:

    ``` toml
    [network]
    network = 'Mainnet'

    [rpc]
    listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:8232"
    ```

3. Compile and run Zebra with `--features "shielded-scan"` and your config file.
   Zebra will start scanning the block chain and inform you about its progress
   each 10 000 blocks in the log.

#### Run the Reader

4. To print the memos in outputs decryptable by the provided scanning key, run
   the reader while also running Zebra. For example:

   ``` bash
   cargo run --release --features shielded-scan --bin scanning-results-reader
   ```
