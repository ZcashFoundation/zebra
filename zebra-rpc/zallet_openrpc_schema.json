The following special strings are also accepted:\n  - `\"ANY_TADDR\"`: Select non-coinbase UTXOs from any transparent addresses\n    belonging to the wallet. Use `z_shieldcoinbase` to shield coinbase UTXOs from\n    multiple transparent addresses.\n  If a unified address is provided for this argument, the TXOs to be spent will be\n  selected from those associated with the account corresponding to that unified\n  address, from value pools corresponding to the receivers included in the UA.\n- `amounts` (array, required) An array of JSON objects representing the amounts to\n  send, with the following fields:\n  - `address` (string, required) A taddr, zaddr, or Unified Address.\n  - `amount` (numeric, required) The numeric amount in ZEC.\n  - `memo` (string, optional) If the address is a zaddr, raw data represented in\n    hexadecimal string format. If the output is being sent to a transparent\n    address, it\u2019s an error to include this field.\n- `minconf` (numeric, optional) Only use funds confirmed at least this many times.\n- `fee` (numeric, optional) If set, it must be null. Zallet always uses a fee\n  calculated according to ZIP 317.\n- `privacy_policy` (string, optional, default=`\"FullPrivacy\"`) Policy for what\n  information leakage is acceptable. One of the following strings:\n  - `\"FullPrivacy\"`: Only allow fully-shielded transactions (involving a single\n    shielded value pool).\n  - `\"AllowRevealedAmounts\"`: Allow funds to cross between shielded value pools,\n    revealing the amount that crosses pools.\n  - `\"AllowRevealedRecipients\"`: Allow transparent recipients. This also implies\n    revealing information described under `\"AllowRevealedAmounts\"`.\n  - `\"AllowRevealedSenders\"`: Allow transparent funds to be spent, revealing the\n    sending addresses and amounts. This implies revealing information described\n    under `\"AllowRevealedAmounts\"`.\n  - `\"AllowFullyTransparent\"`: Allow transaction to both spend transparent funds\n    and have transparent recipients. This implies revealing information described\n    under `\"AllowRevealedSenders\"` and `\"AllowRevealedRecipients\"`.\n  - `\"AllowLinkingAccountAddresses\"`: Allow selecting transparent coins from the\n    full account, rather than just the funds sent to the transparent receiver in\n    the provided Unified Address. This implies revealing information described\n    under `\"AllowRevealedSenders\"`.\n  - `\"NoPrivacy\"`: Allow the transaction to reveal any information necessary to\n    create it. This implies revealing information described under\n    `\"AllowFullyTransparent\"` and `\"AllowLinkingAccountAddresses\"`.",
