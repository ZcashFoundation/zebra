# Default configuration file for running Zebra in Docker.
#
# This file is tailored for Zebra running in Docker. Do not use it with Zebra
# running directly on your localhost as some fields are adjusted specifically
# for Docker.
#
# You can use this file as a starting point for custom configuration. If you
# don't specify a field, Zebra will use its default value.
#
# The config format, including a complete list of sections and fields, is
# documented here:
# https://docs.rs/zebrad/latest/zebrad/config/struct.ZebradConfig.html
