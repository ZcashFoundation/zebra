# We are using five stages:
# - chef: installs cargo-chef
# - planner: computes the recipe file
# - deps: caches our dependencies and sets the needed variables
# - tests: builds tests
# - release: builds release binary
# - runtime: is our runtime environment
#
# This stage implements cargo-chef for docker layer caching
