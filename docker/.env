# Configuration variables for running Zebra in Docker

# Sets the path to a custom Zebra config file. If not set, Zebra will look for a config at
# ${HOME}/.config/zebrad.toml or generate one using environment variables below.
# ! Setting ZEBRA_CONF_PATH will make most of the following environment variables ineffective.
#
# ZEBRA_CONF_PATH="/path/to/your/custom/zebrad.toml"

# Sets the network Zebra runs will run on.
#
# NETWORK=Mainnet

# Zebra's RPC server is disabled by default. To enable it, set its port number.
#
# ZEBRA_RPC_PORT=8232   # Default RPC port number on Mainnet.
# ZEBRA_RPC_PORT=18232  # Default RPC port number on Testnet.

# To disable cookie authentication, set the value below to false.
#
# ENABLE_COOKIE_AUTH=true

# LOG_FILE="/home/zebra/.local/state/zebrad.log"

# Zebra recognizes whether its logs are being written to a terminal or a file,
