# Prometheus configuration for Zebra metrics and tracing
#
# IMPORTANT: The scrape_interval affects Grafana dashboard queries.
# The rate() function requires at least 2 data points, so rate windows
# must be > 2x scrape_interval. With 15s scrape_interval:
#   - rate(...[1m]) works (4 samples)
#   - rate(...[30s]) works (2 samples minimum)
#   - rate(...[1s]) does NOT work (insufficient samples)
#
# If you change scrape_interval, update dashboard rate() windows accordingly.
