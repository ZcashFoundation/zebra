#
# ZEBRA_RPC_PORT=8232   # Default RPC port number on Mainnet.
# ZEBRA_RPC_PORT=18323  # Default RPC port number on Testnet.

# To disable cookie authentication, set the value below to false.
#
# ENABLE_COOKIE_AUTH=true

# Sets a custom directory for the state and network caches. Zebra will also
# store its cookie authentication file in this directory.

# Logging to a file is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the line
# below and alternatively set your own path.
#
# LOG_FILE="/home/zebra/.local/state/zebrad.log"

# Zebra recognizes whether its logs are being written to a terminal or a file,
