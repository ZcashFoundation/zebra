//! [`tower::Service`]s for Zebra's cached chain state.
//!
//! Zebra provides cached state access via two main services:
//! - [`StateService`]: a read-write service that writes blocks to the state,
//!   and redirects most read requests to the [`ReadStateService`].
//! - [`ReadStateService`]: a read-only service that answers from the most
//!   recent committed block.
//!
//! Most users should prefer [`ReadStateService`], unless they need to write blocks to the state.
//!
//! Zebra also provides access to the best chain tip via:
//! - [`LatestChainTip`]: a read-only channel that contains the latest committed
//!   tip.
//! - [`ChainTipChange`]: a read-only channel that can asynchronously await
//!   chain tip changes.
