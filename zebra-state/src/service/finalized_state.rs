//! The primary implementation of the `zebra_state::Service` built upon rocksdb.
//!
//! Zebra's database is implemented in 4 layers:
//! - [`FinalizedState`]: queues, validates, and commits blocks, using...
//! - [`zebra_db`]: reads and writes [`zebra_chain`] types to the database, using...
//! - [`disk_db`]: reads and writes format-specific types to the database, using...
//! - [`disk_format`]: converts types to raw database bytes.
//!
//! These layers allow us to split [`zebra_chain`] types for efficient database storage.
//! They reduce the risk of data corruption bugs, runtime inconsistencies, and panics.
//!
//! # Correctness
//!
//! The [`crate::constants::DATABASE_FORMAT_VERSION`] constant must
//! be incremented each time the database format (column, serialization, etc) changes.
