//! Access to Zebra chain tip information.
//!
//! Zebra has 3 different interfaces for access to chain tip information:
//! * [zebra_state::Request](crate::request): [tower::Service] requests about chain state,
//! * [LatestChainTip] for efficient access to the current best tip, and
//! * [ChainTipChange] to `await` specific changes to the chain tip.
