## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-15

This release adds new request and response variants for transaction lookups to support new RPC methods, introduces a configuration option for backing up the non-finalized state, and refactors error handling for improved type safety and clarity.
Additionally, it fixes a regression in Zebraâ€™s sync performance that was introduced when avoiding the use of the RocksDB merge operator.

### Breaking Changes

- Added new configuration field `Config::should_backup_non_finalized_state`
- Added new request and response enum variants:
  - `Request::AnyChainTransaction`
  - `ReadRequest::{AnyChainTransaction, AnyChainTransactionIdsForBlock}`
  - `Response::AnyChainTransaction`
  - `ReadResponse::{AnyChainTransaction, AnyChainTransactionIdsForBlock}`
- Changed `CommitSemanticallyVerifiedError` from a struct to an enum (#9923).
- Removed the `public spawn_init` function.
- Updated error messages in response to failed `CommitSemanticallyVerifiedBlock` state requests ([#9923](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9923))

## Added

- Added `MappedRequest` trait and `CommitSemanticallyVerifiedBlockRequest` for convenient state response and error type conversions ([#9923](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9923))
