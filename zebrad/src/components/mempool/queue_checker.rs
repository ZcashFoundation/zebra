//! Zebra Mempool queue checker.
//!
//! The queue checker periodically sends a request to the mempool,
//! so that newly verified transactions are added to the mempool,
//! and gossiped to peers.
//!
//! The mempool performs these actions on every request,
//! but we can't guarantee that requests will arrive from peers
//! on a regular basis.
//!
//! Crawler queue requests are also too infrequent,
//! and they only happen if peers respond within the timeout.
