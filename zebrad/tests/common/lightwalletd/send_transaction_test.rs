//! Test sending transactions using a lightwalletd instance connected to a zebrad instance.
//!
//! This test requires a cached chain state that is partially synchronized, i.e., it should be a
//! few blocks below the network chain tip height.
//!
//! The transactions to use to send are obtained from the blocks synchronized by a temporary zebrad
//! instance that are higher than the chain tip of the cached state.
//!
//! The zebrad instance connected to lightwalletd uses the cached state and does not connect to any
//! external peers, which prevents it from downloading the blocks from where the test transactions
//! were obtained. This is to ensure that zebra does not reject the transactions because they have
//! already been seen in a block.
