# Go/No-Go Release Criteria

## Alpha Release

In the first alpha release, we want Zebra to participate in the network and replicate the Zcash chain state. We also want to validate proof of work and the transaction merkle tree, and serve blocks to peers.

### System Requirements

Our CI tests that Zebra builds, passes its tests, and syncs to tip on the following configurations:
* Ubuntu Linux ...

Our CI tests that Zebra builds and passes its tests on the following configurations:
* recent macOS ...
* recent Windows ...

### Build Requirements

Our CI builds Zebra with:
* Rust stable
* recent llvm
* recent clang
* recent libclang

### Supported Platforms

While Zebra is still in alpha, we don't guarantee support for any particular platforms.

But you'll probably get the best results with a recent Ubuntu Linux, or the other platforms that our CI runs on.
