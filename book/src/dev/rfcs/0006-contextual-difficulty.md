# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Zcash nodes use a Proof of Work algorithm to reach consensus on the best chain.
Valid blocks must reach a difficulty threshold, which is adjusted after every
block. The difficulty adjustment calculations depend on the difficulties and
times of recent blocks. So Zebra performs contextual validation [RFC2] of
difficulty adjustments as part of committing blocks to the state.

[RFC2]: ./0002-parallel-verification.md

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The Zcash block difficulty adjustment is one of the core Zcash consensus rules.
Zebra must implement this consensus rule to make sure that its cached chain
state is consistent with the consensus of Zcash nodes.

Difficulty adjustment is also a significant part of Zcash's security guarantees.
It ensures that the network continues to resist takeover attacks, even as the
number of Zcash miners grows.

Difficulty adjustment also ensures that blocks are regularly spaced, which
allows users to create and finalise transactions with short, consistent delays.
These predictable delays contribute to Zcash's usability.
