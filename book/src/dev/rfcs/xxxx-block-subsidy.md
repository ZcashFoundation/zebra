# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Block subsidy is the calculation and validation of rules defined in the Zcash protocol that apply to the coinbase transaction of all incoming blocks. The calculation of block subsidy on each block consists of amounts paid to miners and amounts paid to other participants(founders or funding stream receivers), it also specifies the receiver of these rewards.

At any time in the blockchain history specific rules apply to the coinbase transaction. This validation rules and calculations can change at Network Upgrades.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

All incoming blocks must be validated with the protocol rules, there is no way to avoid this logic to be present in any Zcash protocol compatible implementation such as Zebra.

The amount of rules, calculations, parameters, etc needed to implement the whole Block Subsidy can be overwhelming as each little piece comes together to make a whole. Zebra is in a position where we know all the rules up to the second halving so the implementation can and will be different from `zcashd` but at the end of the day all coinbase transactions will need to be validated as the protocol describes.

This document motivation is to have a clear roadmap about what is needed, the big picture of all components and how they interact together so we can separate a very big task into smaller pieces that we believe will make the implementation easier and better.

# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

- **founders reward**: The portion of the block reward that goes into a pre defined founder address. 
- **funding streams**:  The portion of the block reward that goes into a pre defined funding stream address.
- **miner subsidy**: The portion of the block reward that goes into the miner of the block. 
- **coinbase transaction**: The first transaction in a block where block subsidy is done.
- **NU**: Network Upgrade.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

In Zebra the consensus related code lives in the `zebra-consensus` crate. The block subsidy checks are implemented in `zebra-consensus`, in the following module:

- `zebra-consensus/src/block/subsidy/subsidy.rs` 

Inside `zebra-consensus/src/block/subsidy/` the following submodules will be created:

- `general.rs`: General block reward functions and utilities.
- `founders_reward.rs`: Specific functions related to funders reward.
- `funding_streams.rs`: Specific functions for funding streams.

In addition to calculations the block subsidy requires constants defined in the protocol. The implementation will also create additional constants, all of them will live at:

- `zebra-consensus/src/parameters/subsidy.rs`

Checking functions for blocks are implemented at `zebra-consensus/src/block/check.rs` and they are called at `zebra-consensus/src/block.rs`. This follows the already existing structure for block validation in Zebra.

It is important to note that the Genesis block, BeforeOverwinter, and Overwinter blocks up to Sapling are verified by the CheckpointVerifier so they are not considered in this design. The following table will show what periods are included and what is not in this proposal:

| Height                                 | Miner    | Founder reward | Funding streams | Shielded Coinbase | Target Spacing |

# Reference-level explanation

Given the module structure proposed above all the block subsidy calculations from the protocol must be implemented. The final goal is to do checks for each incoming block and make sure they pass the consensus rules.

To do the calculations and checks the following constants and functions need to be introduced:

## Constants

- `SLOW_START_INTERVAL`
- `SLOW_START_SHIFT`
- `MAX_BLOCK_SUBSIDY`
- `PRE_BLOSSOM_POW_TARGET_SPACING`
- `POST_BLOSSOM_POW_TARGET_SPACING`
- `BLOSSOM_POW_TARGET_SPACING_RATIO`
- `PRE_BLOSSOM_HALVING_INTERVAL`
- `POST_BLOSSOM_HALVING_INTERVAL`
- `FOUNDERS_FRACTION_DIVISOR`
- `FOUNDER_ADDRESS_CHANGE_INTERVAL`
- `FOUNDER_ADDRESSES_MAINNET`
- `FOUNDER_ADDRESSES_TESTNET`

### Funding streams parameter constants

The design suggests to implement the parameters needed for funding streams as:

```
/// The funding stream receiver categories
#[allow(missing_docs)]
pub enum FundingStreamReceiver {
    ElectricCoinCompany,
    ZcashFoundation,
    MajorGrants,
}

/// The numerator for each funding stream receiving category 
/// as described in [protocol specification ยง7.9.1][7.9.1].
/// 
/// [7.9.1]: https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#zip214fundingstreams
const FUNDING_STREAM_RECEIVER_NUMERATORS: &[(FundingStreamReceiver, u64)] = &[
    (FundingStreamReceiver::ElectricCoinCompany, 7),
    (FundingStreamReceiver::ZcashFoundation, 5),
    (FundingStreamReceiver::MajorGrants, 8),
];

/// Denominator as described in [protocol specification ยง7.9.1][7.9.1].
/// 
/// [7.9.1]: https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#zip214fundingstreams
pub const FUNDING_STREAM_RECEIVER_DENOMINATOR: u64 = 100;

#[allow(missing_docs)]
pub enum FundingStreamRange {
    StartHeight,
    EndHeight,
}

/// Start and end Heights for funding streams 
/// as described in [protocol specification ยง7.9.1][7.9.1].
/// 
/// [7.9.1]: https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#zip214fundingstreams
const FUNDING_STREAM_HEIGHT_RANGES: &[(Network, Height, Height)] = &[
    (Network::Mainnet, Height(1_046_400), Height(2_726_400)),
    (Network::Testnet, Height(1_028_500), Height(2_796_000)),
];
```

## General subsidy

The block subsidy and miner reward among other utility functions are inside the general subsidy category.

https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#subsidyconcepts

https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#subsidies

- `block_subsidy(Height, Network) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Total block subsidy.
- `miner_subsidy(Height, Network) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Miner portion.
- `transaction_fees(&Block) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Sum of all the transaction fees.
- `coinbase_sum_outputs(&Transaction) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Sum of all output values in the coinbase transaction.
- `find_output_with_amount(&Transaction, Amount<NonNegative>) -> Vec<transparent::Output>` - Outputs where value equal to Amount.

## Founders reward

Only functions specific to calculation of founders reward.

https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#foundersreward

- `founders_reward(Height, Network) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Founders reward portion for this block.
- `founders_reward_address(Height, Network) -> Result<zebra_chain::transparent:Address::PayToScriptHash, Error>` - Address of the receiver founder at this block. All specified founders reward addresses are transparent `PayToScriptHash` addresses. (Even after the shielded coinbase changes in ZIP-213, introduced in Heartwood.)

## Funding streams

Only functions specific to the calculation of funding streams.

https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#fundingstreams

https://zips.z.cash/zip-0207

https://zips.z.cash/zip-0214

- `funding_stream(height, newtork) -> Result<Amount<NonNegative>, Error>` - Funding stream portion for this block.
- `funding_stream_address(height, network) -> Result<String, Error>` - Address of the funding stream receiver at this block. The same as founders reward the returned address is a `String`.

## Consensus rules

All consensus rules for block subsidy are validated in a function inside `zebra-consensus/src/block/check.rs`:

`subsidy_is_correct(Network, &Block) -> Result<(), BlockError>`

The following consensus rules must be applied to `subsidy_is_correct()`:

### 1 - Founders reward:

*[Pre-Canopy] A coinbase transaction at `height` **MUST** include at least one output that pays exactly `FoundersReward(height)` zatoshi with a standard P2SH script of the form `OP_HASH160 FounderRedeemScriptHash (height) OP_EQUAL` as its scriptPubKey.* https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#foundersreward

We make use of the founders reward functions here. We get the amount of the reward with `founders_reward(height, network)` and the address for the reward at height with `founders_reward_address(height, network)`. Next we get a list of outputs that match the amount with the utility function `find_output_with_amount()`. Finally with this list, we check if any of the output scripts addresses matches our computed address.

### 2 - Funding stream:

*[Canopy onward]  The coinbase transaction at `height` **MUST**  contain at least one output per funding stream `fs` active at
height, that pays `fs.Value(height)` zatoshi in the prescribed way to the streamโs recipient address represented by `fs.AddressList` of `fs.AddressIndex(height)`.* https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#fundingstreams

We make use of the funding streams functions here, similar to founders reward . We get the amount of the reward using `funding_stream(height, network)` and then the address with `funding_stream_address(height, network)`. Next we get a list of outputs that match the amount with the utility function `find_output_with_amount()`. Finally with this list, we check if any of the output scripts matches the address we have computed.

### 3 - Miner subsidy:

*The total amount of transparent outputs from a coinbase transaction, minus the amount of the `valueBalance` field if present, **MUST NOT** be greater than the amount of miner subsidy plus the total amount of transaction fees paid by transactions in this block.* https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#txnencodingandconsensus

So the rule is the following before Canopy:

`coinbase_sum_outputs() <= miner_subsidy() + founders_reward() + transaction_fees()` 

and after Canopy:

`coinbase_sum_outputs() <= miner_subsidy() + funding_stream() + transaction_fees()`

### 4 - Shielded coinbase:

*Zip-213 - Shielded Coinbase* https://zips.z.cash/zip-0213#specification
