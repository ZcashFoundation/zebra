# Treestate

- Feature Name: treestate
- Start Date: 2020-08-31
- Design PR: [ZcashFoundation/zebra#983](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/983)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

To validate blocks involving shielded transactions, we have to check the
computed treestate from the included transactions against the block header
metadata (for Sapling) or previously finalized state (for Sprout). This document
describes how we compute and manage that data, assuming a finalized state
service as described in the [State Updates RFC](https://zebra.zfnd.org/dev/rfcs/0005-state-updates.md).


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Block validation requires checking that the treestate of the block (consisting
of the note commitment tree and nullifier set) is consistent with the metadata
we have in the block header (the root of the note commitment tree) or previously
finalized state (for Sprout).


# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

Many terms used here are defined in the [Zcash Protocol Specification](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf)

**notes**: Represents a value bound to a shielded payment address (public key)
which is spendable by the recipient who holds the spending key corresponding to
a given shielded payment address.

**nullifiers**: Revealed by Spend descriptions when its associated note is spent.

**nullifier set**: The set of unique nullifiers revealed by any transactions
within a block. Nullifiers are enforced to be unique within a valid block chain
by commiting to previous treestates in Spend descriptions, in order to prevent
double-spends.

**note commitments**: Pedersen commitment to the values consisting a note. One
should not be able to construct a note from its commitment.

**note commitment tree**: An incremental Merkle tree of fixed depth used to
store note commitments that JoinSplit transfers or Spend transfers produce. It
is used to express the existence of value and the capability to spend it. It is
not the job of this tree to protect against double-spending, as it is
append-only: that's what the nullifier set is for.

**note position**: The index of a note commitment at the leafmost layer,
counting leftmost to rightmost. The [position in the tree is determined by the
order of transactions in the block](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/canopy.pdf#transactions).

**root**: The layer 0 node of a merkle tree.

**anchor**: A Merkle tree root of a note commitment tree. It uniquely identifies
a note commitment tree state given the assumed security properties of the Merkle
treeâ€™s hash function.  Since the nullifier set is always updated together with
the note commitment tree, this also identifies a particular state of the
associated nullier set.

**spend descriptions**: A shielded Sapling transfer that spends a note. Includes
an anchor of some previous block's note commitment tree.

**output descriptions**: A shielded Sapling transfer that creates a
note. Includes the u-coordinate of the note commitment itself.

**joinsplit**: A shielded transfer that can spend Sprout notes and transparent
value, and create new Sprout notes and transparent value, in one Groth16 proof
statement.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

As blocks are validated, the note commitments revealed by all the transcations
within that block are used to construct note commitment trees, with the note
commitments aligned in their note positions in the bottom layer of the Sprout or
Sapling note tree from the left-most leaf to the right-most in transaction order
in the block. So the Sprout note commitments revealed by the first
JoinSplit<Groth16> in a block would take note position 0 in the Sprout note
commitment tree, for example. Once all the transactions in a block are parsed
and the notes for each tree collected in their appropriate positions, the root
of each tree is computed. While the trees are being built, the respective block
nullifier sets are updated in memory as note nullifiers are revealed. If the
rest of the block is validated according to consensus rules, that root is
committed to its own datastructure via our state service (Sprout anchors,
Sapling anchors). Sapling block validation includes comparing the specified
FinalSaplingRoot in its block header to the root of the Sapling note commitment
tree that we have just computed to make sure they match.

As the transactions within a block are parsed, Sapling shielded transactions
including Spend descriptions and Output descriptions describe the spending and
creation of Zcash Sapling notes, and JoinSplit on Groth16 descriptions to
transfer/spend/create Sprout notes and transparent value. JoinSplit and Spend
descriptions includes an anchor, which references a previous note commitment
tree root: for Spend's, this is a previous block's anchor as defined in their
block header, for JoinSplit's, it may be a previous block's anchor or the root
produced by a previous JoinSplit transfer in its transaction. For Spend's, this
is convenient because we can query out state service for previously finalized
Sapling block anchors, and validate Spend description independently. For
JoinSplit's, if it's not a previously finalized block anchor, it must be the
treestate anchor of previous JoinSplit in this transaction, and we have to wait
for that one to be parsed and its root computed to check that ours is valid.
