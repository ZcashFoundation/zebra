# System Requirements

We recommend the following requirements for compiling and running `zebrad`:

- 4 CPU cores
- 16 GB RAM
- 300 GB available disk space for building binaries and storing cached chain
  state
- 100 Mbps network connection, with 300 GB of uploads and downloads per month

Zebra's tests can take over an hour, depending on your machine. Note that you
might be able to build and run Zebra on slower systems â€” we haven't tested its
exact limits yet.

## Disk Requirements

Zebra uses around 300 GB for cached Mainnet data, and 10 GB for cached Testnet
data. We expect disk usage to grow over time.

Zebra cleans up its database periodically, and also when you shut it down or
restart it. Changes are committed using RocksDB database transactions. If you
forcibly terminate Zebra, or it panics, any incomplete changes will be rolled
back the next time it starts. So Zebra's state should always be valid, unless
your OS or disk hardware is corrupting data.

## Network Requirements and Ports

Zebra uses the following inbound and outbound TCP ports:

- 8233 on Mainnet
- 18233 on Testnet

Outbound connections are required to sync, inbound connections are optional.
Zebra also needs access to the Zcash DNS seeders, via the OS DNS resolver
(usually port 53).

The typical Mainnet network usage is:

- Initial sync: 300 GB download, as already noted, we expect the initial
  download to grow.
- Ongoing updates: 10 MB - 10 GB upload and download per day, depending on
  user-created transaction size and peer requests.

Zebra performs an initial sync every time its internal database version changes,
so some version upgrades might require a full download of the whole chain.

Zebra needs some peers which have a round-trip latency of 2 seconds or less. If
this is a problem for you, please [open a
ticket.](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new/choose)

## Sentry Production Monitoring

Compile Zebra with `--features sentry` to monitor it using Sentry in production.

# Troubleshooting

We continuously test that our builds and tests pass on the _latest_ [GitHub
Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)
for:

- macOS,
- Ubuntu,
- Docker:
  - Debian Bullseye.

## Memory Issues

- If Zebra's build runs out of RAM, try setting `export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2`.
- If Zebra's tests timeout or run out of RAM, try running `cargo test -- --test-threads=2`. Note that `cargo` uses all processor cores on your machine
  by default.

## Network Issues

- Some of Zebra's tests download Zcash blocks, so they might be unreliable
  depending on your network connection. You can set `ZEBRA_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS=1`
  to skip the network tests.
- Zebra may be unreliable on Testnet, and under less-than-perfect network
  conditions. See our [future
  work](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#future-work) for details.

## Issues with Tests on macOS

Some of Zebra's tests deliberately cause errors that make Zebra panic. macOS
records these panics as crash reports. If you are seeing "Crash Reporter"
dialogs during Zebra tests, you can disable them using this Terminal.app
command:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none
```
