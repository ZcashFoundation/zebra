# System Requirements

We recommend the following requirements for compiling and running `zebrad`:

- 4 CPU cores
- 16 GB RAM
- 300 GB available disk space for building binaries and storing cached chain
  state
- 100 Mbps network connection, with 300 GB of uploads and downloads per month

Zebra's tests can take over an hour, depending on your machine. Note that you
might be able to build and run Zebra on slower systems â€” we haven't tested its
exact limits yet.

## Disk Requirements

Zebra uses around 300 GB for cached Mainnet data, and 10 GB for cached Testnet
data. We expect disk usage to grow over time.

Zebra cleans up its database periodically, and also when you shut it down or
restart it. Changes are committed using RocksDB database transactions. If you
forcibly terminate Zebra, or it panics, any incomplete changes will be rolled
back the next time it starts. So Zebra's state should always be valid, unless
your OS or disk hardware is corrupting data.

## Network Requirements and Ports

Zebra uses the following inbound and outbound TCP ports:

- 8233 on Mainnet
- 18233 on Testnet

If you configure Zebra with a specific
[`listen_addr`](https://docs.rs/zebra_network/latest/zebra_network/struct.Config.html#structfield.listen_addr),
it will advertise this address to other nodes for inbound connections. Outbound
connections are required to sync, inbound connections are optional. Zebra also
needs access to the Zcash DNS seeders, via the OS DNS resolver (usually port
53).

Zebra makes outbound connections to peers on any port. But `zcashd` prefers
peers on the default ports, so that it can't be used for DDoS attacks on other
networks.

### Typical Mainnet Network Usage

- Initial sync: 300 GB download. As already noted, we expect the initial
  download to grow.
- Ongoing updates: 10 MB - 10 GB upload and download per day, depending on
  user-created transaction size and peer requests.

Zebra performs an initial sync every time its internal database version changes,
so some version upgrades might require a full download of the whole chain.

Zebra needs some peers which have a round-trip latency of 2 seconds or less. If
this is a problem for you, please [open a
ticket.](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new/choose)
