# Installing Zebra

Zebra is still under development, so there is no supported packaging or
install mechanism. To run Zebra, check out the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra
```
and then run
```
cargo build
```

Be aware that Zebra is still in an extremely early stage of development.
