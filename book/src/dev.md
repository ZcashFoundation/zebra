# Developer Documentation

This section contains the contribution guide and design documentation. It does
not contain:

- The [documentation of the public
  APIs](https://docs.rs/zebrad/latest/zebrad/#zebra-crates) for the latest
  releases of the individual Zebra crates.

- You can also build internal documentation locally by running
  `cargo doc --document-private-items` in the Zebra repository.
