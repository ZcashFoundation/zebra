# Gustavo Valverde - Merged PRs Summary (June 2025 - Present)

This document summarizes all Pull Requests created by `gustavovalverde` that have been merged into the main branch of the ZcashFoundation/zebra repository since June 2025.

## Summary of Merged PRs

### 1. **PR #9716** - CI Concurrency and State Disk Mounting Improvements
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9716
- **Title**: `refactor(ci): improve sync concurrency and state disk mounting`
- **Merged**: July 31, 2025
- **Description**: Improves CI reliability and efficiency by preventing long-running sync operations from being cancelled by PR activity and simplifying disk mounting logic while maintaining compatibility with existing cached state disks. Includes separate concurrency groups for scheduled, manual, and PR workflows, and better handling of different cached disk types.

### 2. **PR #9712** - Prevent Cached State Creation from Failed Tests
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9712
- **Title**: `fix(ci): prevent cached state creation from failed tests`
- **Merged**: July 18, 2025
- **Description**: Fixes an issue where disk images were being created even when the test-result job was cancelled, failed, or timed out, leading to corrupted cached states. Changes the condition to only create disk images when the specific test actually succeeded.

### 3. **PR #9711** - Allow Deploy-Nodes Job to Run for Releases
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9711
- **Title**: `fix(release): allow deploy-nodes job to run for releases`
- **Merged**: July 21, 2025
- **Description**: Fixes an issue where the `deploy-nodes` job was being skipped for releases because it depended on get-disk-name which excluded release events. Now get-disk-name runs for releases but skips disk lookup and provides default outputs, allowing deploy-nodes to proceed with production deployment flow.

### 4. **PR #9621** - Standardize Naming Conventions Across CI and Rust
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9621
- **Title**: `refactor(test)!: standardize naming conventions across CI and Rust`
- **Merged**: June 19, 2025
- **Description**: Standardizes naming conventions across test infrastructure to solve confusion caused by inconsistent naming between workflow jobs, environment variables, and Rust test functions. Renames all test-related identifiers to follow consistent patterns like `state-*`, `sync-*`, `generate-*`, `rpc-*`, and `lwd-*`.

### 5. **PR #9595** - Mark Sync-to-Checkpoint Test as Long-Running
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9595
- **Title**: `fix(ci): mark sync-to-checkpoint test as long-running`
- **Merged**: June 6, 2025
- **Description**: Adds `is_long_test: true` to the sync-to-checkpoint test configuration to allow it to run for more than 3 hours. This addresses timeout issues that started occurring after a database upgrade which invalidated the previous checkpoint cached state.

### 6. **PR #9582** - Handle Tests That Save State Without Requiring Cached Disk
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9582
- **Title**: `fix(ci): handle tests that save state without requiring a cached disk`
- **Merged**: June 4, 2025
- **Description**: Fixes "No branch disk found" errors in tests like `sync-to-checkpoint` that create cached state from scratch. Makes disk search conditional, fixes job dependencies and outputs, and improves image naming reliability by using `RUNNING_DB_VERSION` instead of `STATE_VERSION`.

### 7. **PR #9575** - Pin Lightwalletd to v0.4.17 to Prevent CI Failures
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9575
- **Title**: `fix(ci): pin lightwalletd to v0.4.17 to prevent CI failures`
- **Merged**: June 3, 2025
- **Description**: Pins the lightwalletd version in the CI Dockerfile to prevent integration test failures. The latest lightwalletd was breaking the lightwalletd integration tests.

### 8. **PR #9573** - Prevent Google Cloud Workflow Failures on Fork PRs
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9573
- **Title**: `fix(ci): prevent Google Cloud workflow failures on fork PRs`
- **Merged**: June 3, 2025
- **Description**: Resolves authentication errors when workflows run from forked repositories. Adds missing fork condition to build job in main CD workflow and fixes inverted fork condition in patch-external workflow.

### 9. **PR #9479** - Simplify GCP Integration with create-with-container
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9479
- **Title**: `refactor(ci): simplify GCP integration with create-with-container`
- **Merged**: June 4, 2025
- **Description**: Refactors the GCP integration test workflow to launch Zebra test containers directly using `gcloud compute instances create-with-container`. Replaces the complex `busybox` + `docker run` approach with direct container creation, ensuring logs are sent to Cloud Logging and simplifying the overall workflow structure.

### 10. **PR #9435** - Implement Nextest and Optimize Docker Test Builds
- **URL**: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9435
- **Title**: `feat(ci): implement nextest and optimize Docker test builds`
- **Merged**: August 11, 2025
- **Description**: Implements a modernization of Zebra's test execution and Docker build system. Adds nextest integration with centralized configuration, streamlines feature sets, modernizes CI/CD workflows, simplifies entrypoint logic, and improves test execution performance. Includes 17 specialized test profiles and eliminates unnecessary Rust rebuilds.
