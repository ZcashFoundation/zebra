//! Checkpoint-based block verification.
//!
//! Checkpoint-based verification uses a list of checkpoint hashes to
//! speed up the initial chain sync for Zebra. This list is distributed
//! with Zebra.
//!
//! The checkpoint verifier queues pending blocks.  Once there is a
//! chain from the previous checkpoint to a target checkpoint, it
//! verifies all the blocks in that chain, and sends accepted blocks to
//! the state service as finalized chain state, skipping contextual
//! verification checks.
//!
//! Verification starts at the first checkpoint, which is the genesis
//! block for the configured network.
