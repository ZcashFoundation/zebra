//! Checkpoint-based block verification for Zebra.
//!
//! Checkpoint-based verification uses a list of checkpoint hashes to speed up the
//! initial chain sync for Zebra. This list is distributed with Zebra.
//!
//! The CheckpointVerifier compares each block's `BlockHeaderHash` against the known
//! checkpoint hashes. If it matches, then the block is verified, and added to the
//! `ZebraState`. Otherwise, if the block's height is lower than the maximum checkpoint
//! height, the block awaits the verification of its child block.
//!
//! Verification is provided via a `tower::Service`, to support backpressure and batch
//! verification.
