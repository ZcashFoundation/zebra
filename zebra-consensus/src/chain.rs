//! Chain state updates for Zebra.
//!
//! Chain state updates occur in multiple stages:
//!   - verify blocks (using `BlockVerifier` or `CheckpointVerifier`)
//!   - update the list of verified blocks on disk
//!   - create the chain state needed to verify child blocks
//!   - choose the best tip from all the available chain tips
//!   - update the mature chain state on disk
//!   - prune orphaned side-chains
//!
//! Chain state updates are provided via a `tower::Service`, to support
//! backpressure and batch verification.
