## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-15

In this release, the Sapling parameters were refactored ([#9678](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9678)),
and the Sapling verifiers now use the `BatchValidator`. The transaction verifier was also updated to use
`orchard::bundle::BatchValidator` ([#9308](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9308)).

Additionally, the checkpoint logic was moved out of `zebra-consensus` into `zebra-chain`
to simplify configuration in testnet and regtest modes. ([#9888](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/9888))
